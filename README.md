## Challenges faced 
Challenges Faced
Testing Framework Issues: Initially, I encountered issues with Jest not recognizing tests because I hadnâ€™t configured the test structure properly. This required some adjustments in the test files and ensuring that Jest was set up correctly in the package.json.

Docker Configuration: When containerizing the application, I faced issues with the Dockerfile configuration. I had to ensure that the correct port was exposed and that all dependencies were installed properly in the image.

Handling User Not Found: Creating the logic to handle non-existent users required careful testing to ensure that it returned the correct 404 response, which was challenging initially.

Step-by-Step Process Recap
Set up an Express application to manage user data.
Created endpoints for:
Retrieving all users.
Retrieving a user by ID.
Handling non-existent users.
Installed Jest and Supertest for testing.
Containerized the application using Docker.
Created unit tests to validate the user service's functionality.
Successfully pushed the user service to GitHub.
